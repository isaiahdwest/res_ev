# - Residential PEV Tool - 
## By Isaiah Westphalen
<p>
The Goal of this repository is to produce a tool that will guide potential (residential/personal use) PEV buyers on what options are available to them, navigating incentives, and other misc. bits of info. 

Like fleets we should have the goal of presenting a product to stake holders, however the library built to meet that goal should be general enough to be used in multiple situations, and be able to be used accross languages.

- Energy related
- convenience functions, like saving timestamped copies, etc. should be imported from another repo, so feel free to make those but shouldn't be here
- Would like to include:
  - EV/EVSE database
  - A function to pull latest information from EPA
  - A robust VIN Decoder 
  - I'd like to target more residential stuff but tbh I have no clue what I'm doing here
  - Data driven defaults for vehicles, evses, make ready costs
  - consider more application for HDV/MDVs?
  - News about EVs/incorporate incentives
  - A way to pull incentives for a specific US region
  - Should somehow include supply chain issues/forecasting
