386,US,High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Lane Exemption,"States are allowed to exempt certified alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs)
and electric vehicles (EVs) from HOV lane requirements within the state.
Eligible AFVs are defined as vehicles operating solely on methanol,
denatured ethanol, or other alcohols; a mixture containing at least 85%
methanol, denatured ethanol, or other alcohols; natural gas, propane,
hydrogen, or coal derived liquid fuels; or fuels derived from biological
materials. EVs are defined as vehicles that are recharged from an
external source of electricity and have a battery capacity of at least 4
kilowatt-hours. States are also allowed to establish programs allowing
low-emission and energy-efficient vehicles to pay a toll to access HOV
lanes.

Vehicles must be certified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) and appropriately labeled for use in HOV lanes. The U.S.
Department of Transportation (DOT) is responsible for planning and
implementing HOV programs, including the low-emission and
energy-efficient vehicle criteria EPA established. States that choose to
adopt these requirements will be responsible for enforcement and vehicle
labeling. The HOV exemption for AFVs and EVs expires September 30, 2025
and low-emission and energy-efficient vehicle toll-access to HOV lanes
expires September 30, 2019.

:::

Vehicles Placed in Service After December 31, 2022
--------------------------------------------------

Beginning January 1, 2023, the Clean Vehicle Credit (CVC) provisions
remove manufacturer sales caps, expand the scope of eligible vehicles to
include both EVs and FCEVs, and require a traction battery that has at
least seven kilowatt-hours (kWh). An available tax credit under the CVC
may be limited by the vehicle's MSRP and the buyer's modified adjusted
gross income (see below). The CVC provisions also establish criteria for
a vehicle to be considered eligible that involve sourcing requirements
for critical mineral extraction, processing, and recycling and battery
component manufacturing and assembly; these critical material and
battery component provisions begin to apply only after the U.S.
Department of the Treasury issues guidance on these particular
provisions.

Until the Treasury Department issues this critical mineral and battery
component guidance, the available CVC tax credit amounts to a base
amount of \$2500 plus, for a vehicle that draws propulsion energy from a
battery with at least 7 kWh of capacity, \$417, plus an additional \$417
for each kilowatt hour of battery capacity in excess of 5 kWh. The total
tax credit available for a vehicle may not exceed \$7,500.

Once the Treasury Department issues the critical mineral and battery
component guidance, vehicles that meet the critical mineral requirements
are eligible for \$3,750 tax credit, and vehicles that meet the battery
component requirements are eligible for a \$3,750 tax credit. Vehicles
meeting both the critical mineral and the battery component requirements
are eligible for a total tax credit of \$7,500.

**Critical Minerals:** To be eligible for the \$3,750 critical minerals
portion of the tax credit, the percentage of the value of the battery's
critical minerals that are extracted or processed in the United States
or a U.S. free-trade agreement partner or recycled in North America,
must increase according to the following schedule:

  Year                 Critical minerals minimum percent value requirement
  -------------------- -----------------------------------------------------
  2023                 40%
  2024                 50%
  2025                 60%
  2026                 70%
  2027 and later       80%

**Battery Components:** To be eligible for the \$3,750 battery
components portion of the tax credit, the percentage of the value of the
battery's components that are manufactured or assembled in North America
must increase according to the following schedule:

  Year                 Battery components minimum percent value requirement
  -------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  2023                 50%
  2024 and 2025        60%
  2026                 70%
  2027                 80%
  2028                 90%
  2029 and later       100%

To be eligible for the CVC tax credit, vans, sport utility vehicles, and
pickup trucks must meet the additional requirements of not having a
final manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP) above \$80,000, and all
other vehicles may not have a final MSRP above \$55,000. The final MSRP
can be found on the vehicle's window sticker, which is also known as the
""Monroney label""; the final MSRP includes any trim, options, or
accessories for the particular vehicle and excludes the destination fee.

Additionally, a taxpayer's eligibility for the tax credit may be limited
by thresholds for modified adjusted gross income (MAGI); only
individuals having a MAGI below the following thresholds are eligible
for the tax credit:

-   \$300,000 for joint filers
-   \$225,000 for head-of-household filers
-   \$150,000 for single filers

Further guidance on these provisions is forthcoming. For more
information, including additional eligibility requirements, see the [IRS

website.

Vehicles Purchased Between August 17 and December 31, 2022
----------------------------------------------------------

Qualifying EVs purchased and delivered between August 17, 2022, and
December 31, 2022, are eligible for the tax incentive as described below
for vehicles purchased before August 17, 2022, but are limited to
[vehicles with final assembly in North
America](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/electric-vehicles-for-tax-credit#/tab-2022).
Manufacturer sales caps on vehicles apply. Note that for some
manufacturers, the build location may vary based on the specific
vehicle, trim, or the date in the Model Year when it was produced
because some models are produced in multiple locations. The build
location of a particular vehicle should be confirmed by referring to its
Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) using the U.S. Department of
Transportation's [VIN decoder](https://www.nhtsa.gov/vin-decoder) or an
information label affixed to the vehicle.

**For more information, see [EVs with Final Assembly in North
America](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/electric-vehicles-for-tax-credit#/tab-2022).**

Vehicles Purchased Before August 17, 2022
-----------------------------------------

Qualifying EVs purchased before August 17, 2022, are eligible for a tax
credit that is available for the purchase of a new qualified EV that
draws propulsion using a traction battery that has at least five
kilowatt-hours (kWh) of capacity, uses an external source of energy to
recharge the battery, has a gross vehicle weight rating of up to 14,000
pounds, and meets specified emission standards. The minimum credit
amount is \$2,500, and the credit may be up to \$7,500 based on each
vehicle's traction battery capacity and the gross vehicle weight rating.
The credit will begin to be phased out for each manufacturer in the
second quarter following the calendar quarter in which a minimum of
200,000 qualified PEVs have been sold by that manufacturer for use in
the United States. This tax credit is also available for future EV
owners with a written binding contract to purchase a new qualifying
electric vehicle before August 16, 2022, but do not take possession of
the vehicle until on or after August 16, 2022. For more information,

In cases in which EV charging stations can simultaneously charge more
than one vehicle, the number of EV charging stations provided shall be
considered equivalent to the number of electric vehicles that can be
simultaneously charged.

Beginning January 1, 2023, CBSC must convene a workshop to evaluate
demand for EV charging infrastructure, electric load forecasts, and
statewide transportation electrification goals and use the workshop's
findings to recommend updates to EV charging station building standards.
The workshop must convene and propose recommendations on a triennial
basis. CBSC must also publish guidance and best practices for installing
EV charging stations.
