357,US,Vehicle Acquisition and Fuel Use Requirements for Federal Fleets,"Under the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992, 75% of new light-duty
vehicles acquired by covered federal fleets must be alternative fuel
vehicles (AFVs). As amended in January 2008, Section 301 of EPAct 1992
expands the definition of AFVs to include hybrid electric vehicles, fuel
cell vehicles, and advanced lean burn vehicles. Fleets that use fuel
blends containing at least 20% biodiesel (B20) may earn credits toward
their annual requirements. Federal fleets are also required to use
alternative fuels in dual-fuel vehicles unless the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) approves waivers for agency vehicles; grounds for a waiver
include lack of alternative fuel availability and unreasonable cost (per
EPAct 2005, section 701).

Additional requirements for federal fleets were included in the [Energy
Independence and Security Act of
2007](http://www.afdc.energy.gov/laws/eisa), such as fleet management
plans and petroleum reduction from 2005 levels (Section 142), low
greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting vehicle acquisition requirements (Section
141), and renewable fuel infrastructure installation requirements
(Section 246). For more information, see the [Federal Fleet
Management](https://federalfleets.energy.gov/) website.

To track progress toward meeting AFV acquisition and fuel use
requirements, federal fleets must report on their percent alternative
fuel increase compared to the fiscal year 2005 baseline, alternative
fuel use as a percentage of total fuel consumption, AFV acquisitions as
a percentage of vehicle acquisitions, and fleet-wide miles per gasoline
gallon equivalent of petroleum fuels.

Executive Order 13834, issued in May 2018, requires the Secretary of
Energy (Secretary), in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, the
Administrator of General Services, and the heads of other agencies as
appropriate, to review the existing federal vehicle fleet requirements.
In April 2019, the Secretary provided a report to the Chairman of the
Council on Environmental Quality and the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget detailing opportunities to optimize federal fleet
performance, reduce associated costs, and streamline reporting and
compliance requirements. Specifically, the report recommends that
federal agencies identify and implement strategies to:

-   Right-size the fleet
-   Reduce vehicle miles traveled
-   Implement more fuel efficient vehicles
-   Align the implementation of AFVs and associated fueling
    infrastructure

Executive Order 14008, issued in January 2021, requires the Chair of the
Council on Environmental Quality, the Administrator of General Services,
and the Director of the Office and Management and Budget, in
coordination with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the
Secretary, and the heads of other relevant agencies, to assist the
National Climate Advisor in developing a comprehensive plan to
facilitate clean and zero-emission vehicles for federal, state, local,
and tribal government fleets, including vehicles of the U.S. Postal
Service. The plan must be submitted to the National Climate Task Force
by April 27, 2021.

precursor pollutant) under all possible operational modes and
conditions. Manufacturers with annual sales between 4,501 and 60,000
vehicles may comply with the ZEV requirements through multiple
alternative compliance options that include producing low emission
vehicles and obtaining ZEV credits. Manufacturers with annual sales of
4,500 vehicles or less are not subject to this regulation.

CARB\'s emissions control program for MY 2017 through 2025 combines the
control of smog, soot, and greenhouse gases (GHGs) and requirements for
ZEVs into a single package of standards called Advanced Clean Cars. In
December 2012, CARB finalized new regulatory requirements that allow
vehicle manufacturer compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency\'s GHG requirements for MY 2017-2025 to serve as compliance with
California\'s adopted GHG emissions requirements for those same model
years.

The accounting procedures for MY 2018-2025 are based on a credit system
as shown in the table below. The minimum ZEV requirement for each
manufacturer includes the percentage of passenger cars and light-duty

establish benchmarks to achieve targets for ZEV commercialization and
deployment. These targets include:

-   By 2020, the state will have established adequate infrastructure to
    support one million ZEVs;
-   By 2025, there will be 1.5 million ZEVs on the road in California
    and clean, efficient vehicles will displace 1.5 billion gallons of
    petroleum fuels annually;
-   By 2025, there will be 200 hydrogen fueling stations and 250,000
    electric vehicle (EV) chargers, including 10,000 direct current fast
    chargers, in California;
-   By 2030, there will be 5 million ZEVs on the road in California; and
-   By 2050, greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector
    will be 80% less than 1990 levels.

State agencies must also work with their stakeholders to accomplish the
following:

-   Develop new criteria for clean vehicle incentive programs to
    encourage manufacturers to produce clean, affordable cars;
-   Update the 2016 ZEV Action plan, with a focus on low income and
    disadvantaged communities;
-   Recommend actions to increase the deployment of ZEV infrastructure
    through the Low Carbon Fuel Standard;
-   Support and recommend policies that will facilitate the installation
    of EV infrastructure in homes and businesses; and
-   Ensure EV charging and hydrogen fueling are affordable and
    accessible to all drivers.

The ZEV promotion plan additionally directs the state fleet to increase
the number of ZEVs in the fleet through gradual vehicle replacement. By
2020, ZEVs should make up at least 25% of the fleet's light-duty
vehicles. Vehicles with special performance requirements necessary for
public safety and welfare are exempt from this requirement. For more
